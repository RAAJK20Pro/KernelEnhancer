### GPU & Thermal Management
- Disabled AdrenoBoost, touch boost, GPU thermal throttling, and bus sleeping
- Locked GPU min frequency and enabled constant rail/clock control
- Set `simple_ondemand` GPU governor for responsive scaling

### Memory & Cache Tweaks
- Tuned ZRAM read ahead and swappiness for app/system groups
- Optimized VFS cache pressure and enabled aggressive dirty memory flushing
- Cleaned caches and adjusted stat interval for consistent memory performance

### I/O Scheduler & Read-Ahead
- Applied `noop` I/O scheduler to all block devices
- Increased `read_ahead_kb` for storage and RAM blocks
- Disabled I/O stats, randomness, and rotational flags for SSD optimizations

### Entropy & FSYNC
- Optimized entropy thresholds for random number generation
- Disabled FSync for reduced write latency (at risk of data loss on crash)

### LPDDR4X Bandwidth Control
- Set min/max DDR and LLCC bandwidth frequencies
- Locked devfreq paths with read-only permissions for consistency

### App & Background Management
